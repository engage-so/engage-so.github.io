# Lists

Lists are manually created user groups you can add users to or remove users from. They are an easy way to send broadcasts to multiple users. Besides manually adding users to a list from the user page on the dashboard, you can add users to a list using the API, import users through a CSV file, copy and paste emails or embed an HTML form on your website. 

Here are some use cases:
- Newsletter subscription
- Application invite (we currently use a list for Engage's private invite)
