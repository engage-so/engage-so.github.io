# API

## Authentication
Authentication is via [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) using your API key as username and API secret as password. On some endpoints, you can use just your API key (as username) and leave the secret empty. This makes it possible to call such endpoints from the clientside. The endpoints are marked below.
