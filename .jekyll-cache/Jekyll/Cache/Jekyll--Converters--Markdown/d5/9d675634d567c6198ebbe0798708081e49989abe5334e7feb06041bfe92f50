<p>Engage is customer messaging for growth and retention. It is messaging based on your customerâ€™s journey, preferences and actions through your application. How this is achieved is by segmenting customers based on their attributes (e.g, gender, location, plan, age) and their actions (e.g, used up data bandwidth, canceled subscription, scheduled an appointment, submitted a feedback), and allowing you directly â€œmessageâ€ these segments or create automations.</p>

<p>Customer attributes, events and actions are tracked in a couple of ways. The <a href="/docs/guides/connecting-user-data">connecting user data page</a> details how this is achieved and is a good place to start from.</p>

<p>This guide is a work in progress. It hopes to explain some of Engageâ€™s concepts in clear terms. If there is something you are not clear about or canâ€™t find, please send an email to hello@engage.so or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/engage_so">@engage_so</a>.</p>
