<p>Engage supports adding team members to an account. Each member can be assigned any of the four available roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Admin</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Manager</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Developer</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Member</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These roles define what what they can do. There is a fifth <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Owner</code> role that is automatically assigned to the account creator. This role grants all privilege to the account, including deletion. The role can be transfered by its owner to another member. However, only one member of a team can have the role at a given time. On transfer, the role of the member transferring will be changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin</code>.</p>
