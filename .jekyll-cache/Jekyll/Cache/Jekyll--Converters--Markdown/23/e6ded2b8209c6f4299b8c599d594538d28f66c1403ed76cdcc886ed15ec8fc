<p>Whatâ€™s better than being able to send broadcasts to customer segments and lists is creating messages that can be automatically sent based on data driven triggers. For example, automatically send a renewal reminder mail for upcoming subscription renewal.</p>

<p>Automations are useful for a lot of things. You can use them for simple automated messaging like welcome emails to more complex workflows for proper customer onboarding. Here is an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On new profile, send a welcome message</li>
  <li>If customer is yet to activate their card</li>
  <li>Send them an email asking if there is a way to help</li>
  <li>Wait for 4 more days</li>
  <li>If card still not activated, send another nudge</li>
</ul>

<p>With automations, you can easily upsell or move customers to the next phase of the growth cycle, whether that is acquisition to activation or activation to retention. This is what we mean when we say we are messaging for customer growth and retention.</p>
