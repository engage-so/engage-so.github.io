<h1 id="sending-broadcasts">Sending broadcasts</h1>

<p>Broadcasts are how you send manual messages to your customer <a href="/docs/guides/segments">segments</a> and <a href="/docs/guides/lists">lists</a>. We currently supports the following channels for sending broadcasts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>SMS</li>
  <li>Push notifications (FCM)</li>
</ol>

<p>More channels coming soon.</p>

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>

<p>Sending an email broadcast requires configuring your domain or connecting an email service provider. If not yet done, you can do this from the integrations page. If you choose to use Engage as your email service, we generate some DNS values to add to your domainâ€™s DNS. This is to allow you send emails using any email under the domain as sender.</p>

<p>The beauty of Engage is that we let you bring your existing messaging infrastructure. If you already use any of the email service providers (ESP) we support, you can connect the service and use it for your email broadcasts (and <a href="/docs/guides/automations">automations</a>). We currently support Amazon SES, Mailgun, Sparkpost and working on Postmark and Sendgrid. The other advantage of using your existing ESP is that we can provide you detailed analytics and reporting for your transactional emails and help you manage your <a href="/docs/guides/templates">transactional email templates</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sms">SMS</h2>

<p>You can send SMS broadcasts to your customer segments or lists. The broadcast will be sent to customers with phone numbers attached to their profile. At the moment, you will need to connect an SMS gateway to send SMS broadcasts. You can do this on the <a href="https://app.engage.so/settings/integrations">Integrations page</a>. We currently support Twilio, Termii and Hollatags. More providers including Vonage, Infobip and Africaâ€™s talking are coming shortly.</p>

<h2 id="push-notifications-fcm">Push notifications (FCM)</h2>

<p>You can send push notifications to customer segments or lists by connecting your FCM account to Engage. You can connect your FCM account from the <a href="https://app.engage.so/settings/integrations">Integrations page</a>. Before you can send push notification to a customer, remember that their device token needs to have been attached to their Engage profile. You can use the API or any of the available SDKs to do this, i.e update the customerâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">device_token</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">device_platform</code>. We currently store up to 5 device tokens per customer. When you send a broadcast, it is sent to all the device tokens connected to the customerâ€™s profile.</p>
