      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This service is committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

      <h3>Information collected and how it is used</h3>
      <p>When you sign up, the service collects your email and a password for identification purpose. These credentials allow you access the service and provides an identifier to map everything related to you on the service to. Without this, you will not be able to access the service. We also use your email to communicate with you and send you weekly reports about your account.</p>

      <p>Engage supports integrations with a number of third party tools. For Mailgun and Amazon SES, we ask you to provide your Mailgun API Key or access keys to your Amazon SES/SNS. This is used to get information related to the account domains, set an endpoint (webhook) where mail events can be sent to and send quick mail from the Engage dashboard. In plain terms, we collect this information to be able to provide the necessary reporting and analytics.</p>

      <p>For Stripe, we redirect you to your Stripe account to authenticate. This grant a read-only access to Engage and lets Engage get billing events for your customers. Read-only access means Engage cannot make any changes or update to your Stripe account.</p>

      <p>You can connect a Slack account to get notifications and reports on. When you do, the service redirects you to Slack for access authorisation. The scope of the access is limited to just what it is needed for&mdash;to send the required notifications to your selected Slack channel. It can not do anything else, e.g., read your Slack conversations. The information we collect from Slack are your team name and a [webhook] URL we can send reports to.</p>

      <p>We use third party tools like Stripe for payment. These tools use tracking technologies and collect data like IP address, Device identifiers, Web browser information, Page view statistics, Browsing history, Usage information and Log data (e.g. access times, hardware and software information). This data is used to analyse usage, provide support for you, protect against fraudulent, illegal or harmful actions and facilitate payment.</p>

      <p>When you login, a tiny piece of information (called cookies) is stored on your browser for authentication purpose. These cookies only last during the browsing session and does not contain any sensitive data about you.</p>

      <p>Your data is yours and you can delete your account anytime. Simply login to your dashboard and go to your profile settings to do so. All data related to you will be completely removed from the system. You can also export your logs any time.<p>

      <h3>Information Disclosure</h3>

      <p>We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any information related to you to any third party. We may provide non-personal statistics about the service use and traffic patterns to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Here are trusted entities your data is shared with:</p>

        <li>Stripe: <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> is a leader in online payments. Engage uses Stripe to manage payments. When you enter your card details, it is securely sent to Stripe with your email. Stripe uses this to process the necessary payment.</li>0
        <li>AWS, Google Cloud and DigitalOcean: Source and database hosting</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All collected data are protected by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>
