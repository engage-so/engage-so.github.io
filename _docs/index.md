# Introduction

Engage is a customer messaging platform that helps you send personalized messages to your customers based on your customer's journey, preferences and actions through your application. How this is achieved is that you send your customer data to Engage, Engage in turn makes it easy to use these data to group customers by their attributes (e.g., gender, location, plan, age) or/and their actions (e.g., used up data bandwidth, canceled subscription, scheduled an appointment, submitted a feedback). In marketing speak, this is called [Segmentation](https://engage.so/blog/customer-segmentation-explained-how-it-works-and-why-it-is-important/). Once you have your segments, you can then send campaigns to these segments. But that's not all. You can also create message workflows that can be automatically triggered.

Customer attributes, events and actions are tracked in a couple of ways. The [connecting user data page](/docs/guides/connecting-user-data) details how this is achieved and is a good place to start from.

This guide is a work in progress. It hopes to explain some of Engage's concepts in clear terms. If there is something you are not clear about or can't find, please send an email to [hello@engage.so](mailto:hello@engage.so) or tweet [@engage_so](https://twitter.com/engage_so).
